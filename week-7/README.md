Q1: Are the majority of the CpG dinucleotides methylated or unmethylated?
The majority are methylated.




Q2: How does using nanopore for methylation calling differ from bisulfite sequencing in terms of coverage? Which method appears better and why?
Nanopore has less coverage than bisulfite sequencing. In terms of coverage, bisulfite sequencing is best. 

3A #2:
Number of sites in bismark: 132466
Number of sites in nanopore: 53346
Percentage of shared sites:95.85468138657977 %



Question 2:
Nanopore sequencing has less coverage than bisulfite sequencing. Overall, I think nanopore is the best because it has ~96% similarity in terms of sites, but there are more sites sequenced with nanopore.
