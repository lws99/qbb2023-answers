Question 2:

What fraction of peaks were retained when intersected compared to sample1? Sample2?
sample1: 36%
sample2: 36%


Question 3:
How reproducible are the peaks called between the two samples? Is the p-value range of a peak indicative of reproducibility? Is it completely consistent?

The peaks are fairly similar/reproducible between the two samples. The p-value range of a peak is not indicative of reproducibility, but comparison of peaks between replicates can give you an idea of reproducibility. The p-values are not completely consistient between the replicates, but they values are very similar.
